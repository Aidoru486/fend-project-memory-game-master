# Memory Game Project

## The Game

You are presented 16 shuffled cards facing down and the goal is to pair together the cards with the same image. By clicking on one card the image is revealed and in one move you can reveal two cards. The game is over when you have matched all cards.

## Score

The score is evaluated through the amount of moves, time and stars you need to complete the game.
The results are shown once you complete the game.
There is no time limit and if all cards match you win, independently of the number of moves or stars

Once you win a modal window pops up showing the score and giving you a chance to download the original illustration as a screensaver for desktop and phone/tablet.
